# JavaScript interaction

There are 3 JavaScript interaction that I have created for the 1-page website which are:

1. The "topBtn" button is implemented in this code by making it visible as the user scrolls down down 20 pixels from the top and scrolling to the top when it was        clicked.

2.Image change on mouseover or mouseout is implemented for the image with the ID "image" using the newPicture and oldPicture functions. So, the image source changes 
  to love2.jpg" on mouseover and reverts to "love.png" on mouseout.

3. Button clickackable also implemented in this code when a user press the "New Contributors" or "Existing Contributors" button, the website will effectively scroll     to the form with the ID "register-form1" or "register-form2" and displaying it in the browser window. The method that scrolls the element into the visible area of     the browser window is scrollIntoView().
